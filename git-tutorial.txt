Git is version history for codes or projects
It allows us to save past versions of our codes
We can check version history in Git
There are two main areas in Git
Staging area is where Git keeps changes that have been picked to go into next version
Working area is where all changes we are working on, not yet committed.
Git branching points to the latest commit in the branch
Uploading codes to GitHub is known as Push
Branching in Git enables DevOps Engineers to work on multiple repositories at a time
When two branches are merged, the result will go to the current working brach.
Git merge creats a commit hash to store merging process.
We can have more a branch on a project, and finally merge all the branches to Master or Main branch.
